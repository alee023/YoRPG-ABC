- 11/22/16 // - made methods about, specialize, and normalize in class Character abstract

Instructions:

1. When prompted to choose your difficulty, type in "1" for easy, "2" for medium, and "3" for difficult. 

2. Type in what you want to be called. 

3. Choose your character. Type in the full name of the character, capitalized. 

4. You will be shown the character's stats. When a monster, or super monster, comes along, type in "1" to normalize and "2" to specialize. Specialize allows you to inflict more damage on the monster, but you run the risk of incurring more damage. Normalize lets you perform a normal attack. 

5. Repeat until the monster dies or you die. If the monster dies, up to four more monsters will come along. 

6. Repeat until you die or the game ends.
